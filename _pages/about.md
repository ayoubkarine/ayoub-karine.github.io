I received the master’s degree in computer science and telecommunications in 2014 at the Mohammed University in Rabat-Morocco,  and the PhD degree in machine learning applied to remote sensing in 2018 from the University of Western Brittany-France. From 2017 to 2019, I was a Temporary Lecturer and Research Assistant (ATER) at the University of Haute Alsace-France. Since Septembre 2019, I am an associate professor on computer science at [ISEN Yncréa Ouest/Nantes campus](https://isen-nantes.fr/). My research interests include data science, machine learning, remote sensing, computer vision and are conducted in [L@bISEN – Yncréa Ouest/AI-ED Departement/VISION-AD Team](https://isen-brest.fr/recherche/)
